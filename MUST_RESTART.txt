⚠️  CRITICAL: APP MUST BE RESTARTED ⚠️
========================================

The code has been fixed multiple times but the app is still running OLD CODE!

SYMPTOMS OF OLD CODE:
❌ Generates 8 questions (not 10)
❌ Topic is "documents" in general
❌ Message says "prepared a quiz for you"
❌ No mention of document titles

NEW CODE WILL SHOW:
✅ Generates exactly 10 questions
✅ Topic is your document names
✅ Message says "Switch to Student Quiz tab"
✅ Shows "Retrieved X from 2 documents"

========================================
HOW TO RESTART:
========================================

Option 1: Find the Streamlit terminal
  1. Look for terminal with "You can now view your Streamlit app..."
  2. Click on that terminal
  3. Press Ctrl+C
  4. Wait for it to stop
  5. Run: streamlit run apps/ui.py

Option 2: Force kill
  In a terminal:
    pkill -9 -f streamlit
    cd /home/henry/Projects/ai-tutor
    streamlit run apps/ui.py

Option 3: Check process and kill
  ps aux | grep streamlit
  kill <PID>
  streamlit run apps/ui.py

========================================
VERIFY IT WORKED:
========================================

After restart, type: "create 10 quizzes from the documents"

If you see:
✅ "10-question quiz" → WORKING!
✅ Your document names → WORKING!
✅ "Switch to Student Quiz tab" → WORKING!

If you still see:
❌ "8-question quiz on documents" → NOT RESTARTED YET!

========================================

The code is ready. Just needs restart!
