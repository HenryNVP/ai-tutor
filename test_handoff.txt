Test Questions for Handoff Logic Verification
==============================================

After fixing the orchestrator, test these questions and verify handoff behavior:

STEM Questions (Should delegate to qa_agent → web_agent):
---------------------------------------------------------
1. "What is the Bernoulli equation?"
   Expected: Handoff to qa_agent, then web_agent if no local materials
   Should see: Citations with [1], [2], etc. or URLs

2. "Explain Newton's first law"
   Expected: Handoff to qa_agent (if physics materials exist) or web_agent
   Should see: Citations from textbook or web sources

3. "How does photosynthesis work?"
   Expected: Handoff to qa_agent → web_agent
   Should see: Detailed answer with references

4. "What is a binary search tree?"
   Expected: Handoff to qa_agent → web_agent
   Should see: CS/coding explanation with citations

5. "Derive the quadratic formula"
   Expected: Handoff to qa_agent → web_agent
   Should see: Mathematical derivation with references

Non-STEM Questions (Should delegate to web_agent):
-------------------------------------------------
6. "What happened in the 2024 election?"
   Expected: Direct handoff to web_agent
   Should see: Current information with URLs

7. "Who won the latest Nobel Prize?"
   Expected: Direct handoff to web_agent
   Should see: Recent information with sources

System Questions (Should answer directly):
-----------------------------------------
8. "What can you help me with?"
   Expected: Direct answer from orchestrator
   Should see: System capabilities explanation

9. "What's my learning progress?"
   Expected: Direct answer from orchestrator
   Should see: Profile/progress information

10. "Hello, how are you?"
    Expected: Direct answer from orchestrator
    Should see: Simple greeting response

Quiz Requests (Should use generate_quiz tool):
---------------------------------------------
11. "Give me a quiz on thermodynamics"
    Expected: generate_quiz tool call
    Should see: "Quiz is ready" message

12. "Test me on Newton's laws with 5 questions"
    Expected: generate_quiz tool call with count=5
    Should see: Quiz generation confirmation

How to Verify:
--------------
1. Run the tutor interface
2. Ask each question
3. Check OpenAI traces for handoff events
4. Verify citations appear in responses
5. Confirm STEM questions are NOT answered directly

OpenAI Trace Indicators:
-----------------------
✅ Good: See "handoff to qa_agent" or "handoff to web_agent"
✅ Good: See tool calls to "retrieve_local_context" or "web_search"
✅ Good: Response includes [1], [2] citations or URLs

❌ Bad: Orchestrator answers directly without handoff
❌ Bad: No citations in STEM question responses
❌ Bad: Response says "I know that..." without sources
