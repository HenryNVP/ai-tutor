## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Python 3.10+
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Demo Mode

The system includes demo mode (enabled by default in `config/default.yaml`) which:
- ✅ Disables personalization (faster startup, simpler code)
- ✅ Uses static difficulty/style (consistent experience)
- ✅ Simplified routing (keyword-based only)
- ✅ Focuses on core RAG capabilities

**Alternative**: Use `config/demo.yaml` for minimal configuration:
```bash
# Use demo config (minimal settings)
python -c "from ai_tutor.system import TutorSystem; system = TutorSystem.from_config('config/demo.yaml')"
```

### Launch the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run apps/ui.py
```

The app uses `config/default.yaml` by default (demo mode enabled).

The app opens at `http://localhost:8501` with two tabs:
- **💬 Chat & Learn** – Q&A, quizzes, visualizations, generated files manager
- **📚 Corpus Management** – Browse and manage documents

### Launch the FastAPI Backend

```bash
uvicorn apps.api:app --reload --port 8080
```

Endpoints:
- `POST /answer` — answer questions with citations
- `POST /quiz` — create quizzes
- `POST /ingest` — upload & ingest documents
- `POST /sessions/{learner_id}/reset` — clear history
- `GET /health` — health check

### (Optional) Start MCP Servers

Enable richer tool access by launching the MCP servers before opening the UI:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Chroma retrieval tools (collections, queries, etc.)
cd chroma_mcp_server
python server.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 2 — Filesystem workspace tools (list/read/write project files)
cd filesystem_mcp_server
python server.py
```

Then set the environment flags so Streamlit connects automatically:

```bash
export MCP_USE_SERVER=true            # Chroma MCP (port 8000 by default)
export FS_MCP_USE_SERVER=true         # Filesystem MCP (port 8100 by default)
```

You can customise ports and root directories via `MCP_PORT`, `FS_MCP_PORT`, and `FS_MCP_ROOT`. The sidebar shows connection status and restart hints if a server is unavailable.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### System Overview

```
User Message → Orchestrator Agent → Specialized Tools/Agents
    ↓
    ├─→ generate_quiz tool → Quiz (3-40 questions)
    ├─→ QA Agent → Retriever → Answer with citations
    ├─→ Visualization Agent → Plot generation
    ├─→ Web Agent → Current information
    └─→ Ingestion Agent → Document processing
```

### Multi-Agent System

The system uses **6 specialized agents** with keyword-based routing:

- **QA Agent** (`qa`) - Answers questions using RAG from documents (default route)
- **Quiz Agent** (`quiz`) - Generates quizzes from document content (3-40 questions)
- **Note Agent** (`note`) - Creates structured study notes and summaries, can save to files
- **Visualization Agent** (`visualization`) - Generates data visualizations from CSV files
- **Web Agent** (`web`) - Fetches current information from the web
- **Ingestion Agent** (`ingestion`) - Processes and stores uploaded documents

Requests are automatically routed based on keywords (e.g., "quiz" → Quiz Agent, "summarize" → Note Agent).

### Core Components

**1. Document Ingestion**
- Supports PDF, TXT, Markdown
- Semantic chunking (512 tokens)
- Vector embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- Metadata tracking (title, page, source)

**2. Retrieval System**
- ChromaDB vector store (default, production-ready)
- Vector similarity search with cosine distance
- Source filtering for uploaded documents
- Top-k configurable (default: 5-8)
- Citation generation with page numbers
- Automatic persistence (SQLite backend)

**3. Quiz Generation**
- Dynamic question count (3-40)
- Topic extraction from context
- Multiple choice format
- Source-filtered retrieval
- Interactive UI + Markdown export

**4. Adaptive Learning**

**5. Tutor Service Layer**
- Shared backend API used by Streamlit and FastAPI
- Manages retrieval, ingestion, quiz creation, and error handling
- Ensures UI stays presentation-only
- Learner profiling by domain
- Performance tracking
- Difficulty adjustment
- Progress monitoring

## 📊 Quiz Generation

### Capabilities

- **3-40 questions** per quiz
- **Automatic topic extraction** from uploaded documents
- **Document grounding** – Questions based on YOUR files
- **Interactive interface** – Radio buttons, instant feedback
- **Markdown export** – Download and share

### How It Works

```
User: "create 20 questions from the documents"
  ↓
Orchestrator extracts: topic='computer vision', count=20
  ↓
Calls: generate_quiz(topic='computer vision', count=20)
  ↓
Quiz Service:
  • Retrieves content from uploaded docs (source filtering)
  • Calculates max_tokens dynamically: (20 × 150) + 500 = 3500
  • Generates 20 questions with LLM
  ↓
UI displays interactive quiz
  ↓
User takes quiz, gets results & explanations
```


## 📈 Data Visualization

### Workflow

```
1. Upload: data csv file
2. Request: e.g, plot revenue by month
3. Agent:
   • Inspects dataset (columns, types, sample rows)
   • Generates matplotlib code via LLM
   • Executes in safe environment
   • Returns base64-encoded PNG
4. UI displays plot in chat
5. User clicks "View generated code" to see Python
```

## 🔍 Retrieval Features

### Vector Store

- **Embeddings**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions)
- **Storage**: In-memory numpy arrays + metadata
- **Similarity**: Cosine similarity search
- **Metadata**: Title, page, domain, source path

### Source Filtering

Search ONLY uploaded documents:

```python
Query(
    text="machine learning",
    source_filter=["lecture9.pdf"]
)
```

## 📊 Learner Profiles

### Tracked Metrics

- Strengths/struggles per domain (e.g., "Physics-Mechanics")
- Study time and questions mastered
- Quiz performance over time
- Difficulty progression

### Adaptive Adjustment

| Quiz Score | Action | Next Step |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| ≥ 70% | Challenge | Harder topics |
| 40-69% | Guided | Targeted practice |
| < 40% | Foundational | Review basics |
