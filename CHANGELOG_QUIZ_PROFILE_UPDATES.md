# Changelog: Quiz Profile Update Feature

## Summary

Implemented automatic learner profile updates based on quiz performance. When a learner completes a quiz, their profile is now automatically updated with domain strengths, struggles, concepts mastered, study time, and difficulty preferences.

## Changes Made

### Core Implementation

#### 1. `/src/ai_tutor/learning/quiz.py`
- **Modified `evaluate_quiz()` method**:
  - Now calls `_update_profile_from_quiz()` when a profile is provided
  - Returns the evaluation with profile already updated

- **Added `_update_profile_from_quiz()` method**:
  - Updates domain strengths based on quiz score (0.02-0.15 increase)
  - Updates domain struggles based on quiz score (-0.10 to +0.12 adjustment)
  - Tracks concepts mastered for each correct answer (+0.15 mastery)
  - Updates difficulty preferences based on performance:
    - ≥80%: "independent challenge"
    - 50-79%: "guided practice"
    - <50%: "foundational guidance"
  - Adds estimated study time (1.5 minutes per question)
  - Sets next topic based on review topics
  - Logs profile updates for debugging

### UI Enhancements

#### 2. `/apps/quiz.py`
- **Added profile update notification**:
  - Shows "✨ Your learner profile has been updated" message after quiz submission

- **Added Profile Summary sidebar section**:
  - Displays real-time learner profile information
  - Shows name, study time, top strengths, areas needing support, and preferences
  - Updates automatically after quiz completion
  - Handles errors gracefully

### Documentation

#### 3. `/docs/quiz_profile_updates.md` (NEW)
- Comprehensive documentation of the feature
- Explains profile update logic and scoring thresholds
- Provides usage examples (UI and programmatic)
- Lists benefits and future enhancement ideas
- Includes troubleshooting guide

#### 4. `/README.md`
- Added quiz feature to Features section
- Added new "Quiz Application" section with:
  - Instructions for running the quiz app
  - Overview of quiz app capabilities
  - Link to demo script
  - Link to detailed documentation

### Demo & Testing

#### 5. `/scripts/demo_profile_update.py` (NEW)
- Executable demo script showing profile updates in action
- Creates test learner profile
- Generates quiz on "Newton's laws of motion"
- Simulates quiz answers (75% score)
- Shows before/after profile comparison
- Displays all profile changes with detailed metrics

#### 6. `/tests/test_quiz_profile_updates.py` (NEW)
- Unit tests for profile update functionality
- Tests excellent performance (100% score)
- Tests poor performance (25% score)
- Tests moderate performance (50% score)
- Tests concept mastery tracking
- Tests profile persistence

## Technical Details

### Profile Update Logic

The profile update logic is score-based:

| Score Range | Strength Delta | Struggle Delta | Difficulty Preference |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| ≥80%        | +0.15          | -0.10          | independent challenge |
| 60-79%      | +0.10          | -0.05          | guided practice      |
| 40-59%      | +0.05          | +0.05          | guided practice      |
| <40%        | +0.02          | +0.12          | foundational guidance |

### Domain Inference

The quiz topic is converted to lowercase and used as the domain identifier. For example:
- "Newton's laws of motion" → "newton's laws of motion" (domain)

### Concept Tracking

For each correctly answered question:
- First 50 characters of the question are used as the concept identifier
- Concept mastery is increased by 0.15 (capped at 1.0)
- This allows tracking of fine-grained knowledge

### Time Estimation

Study time is estimated as 1.5 minutes per question and added to the learner's total study time.

## Usage Examples

### Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run scripts/quiz_app.py
```

1. Enter learner ID
2. Enter quiz topic
3. Click "Generate quiz"
4. Answer questions
5. Click "Submit answers"
6. View results and updated profile in sidebar

### Demo Script

```bash
python scripts/demo_profile_update.py
```

Shows complete before/after profile comparison with detailed metrics.

### Programmatic

```python
from ai_tutor.system import TutorSystem

system = TutorSystem.from_config()

# Generate quiz
quiz = system.generate_quiz(
    learner_id="student123",
    topic="Physics",
    num_questions=4,
)

# Evaluate (profile is automatically updated)
evaluation = system.evaluate_quiz(
    learner_id="student123",
    quiz_payload=quiz,
    answers=[0, 1, 2, 1],
)

# Load updated profile
profile = system.personalizer.load_profile("student123")
print(profile.domain_strengths)
```

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/test_quiz_profile_updates.py -v
```

All tests pass:
- ✓ test_excellent_performance_updates_profile
- ✓ test_poor_performance_updates_profile
- ✓ test_moderate_performance_balanced_updates
- ✓ test_concepts_mastered_only_for_correct_answers
- ✓ test_profile_persistence

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified
- `src/ai_tutor/learning/quiz.py`
- `apps/quiz.py`

## No Breaking Changes

This feature is backward compatible:
- Profile updates are optional (only occur when profile is provided)
- Existing quiz evaluation functionality remains unchanged
- All existing code continues to work without modification

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Future quizzes adapt to learner's demonstrated knowledge
2. **Progress Tracking**: Learners can see their improvement over time
3. **Adaptive Difficulty**: System automatically adjusts challenge level
4. **Motivation**: Visual feedback encourages continued learning

2. Weighted updates based on question difficulty
3. Historical performance tracking and trends
4. Concept graph with prerequisite relationships
5. Spaced repetition scheduling
6. Adaptive quiz generation based on weak areas
7. Batch quiz analysis and insights
