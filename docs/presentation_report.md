### 1.1 Project Goals and Motivation

The STEM AI Tutor addresses a critical gap in personalized education for pre-college students. Traditional classroom settings often fail to adapt to individual learning paces, while online resources lack coherent structure and personalization. This system aims to:

- **Democratize STEM Education**: Provide high-quality, personalized tutoring accessible to all students regardless of geographic or economic constraints
- **Ground Learning in Verified Materials**: Ensure all answers are sourced from curated textbooks and course materials, minimizing misinformation
- **Adapt to Individual Progress**: Track student strengths and struggles across domains (mathematics, physics, computer science) to tailor difficulty and content
- **Foster Active Learning**: Generate interactive assessments that reinforce concepts and identify knowledge gaps
- **Maintain Transparency**: Provide citations for all claims, enabling students to verify information and explore topics deeper

### 1.2 Core System Logic

The system operates on a **multi-agent architecture** with specialized components handling distinct aspects of the tutoring experience:

```

**Orchestrator Agent**: Routes incoming queries based on intent:
- STEM questions (physics, math, CS, chemistry, etc.) → QA Agent
- Current events or non-STEM topics → Web Agent
- Assessment requests → Quiz Generator
- Document uploads → Ingestion Agent

**QA Agent**: Performs retrieval-augmented generation:
1. Embeds the student's question using sentence transformers
2. Retrieves top-k semantically similar chunks from vector store
3. Generates answer grounded in retrieved passages
4. Formats citations with document titles and page numbers

**Quiz Generator**: Creates adaptive assessments:
1. Retrieves relevant course content based on topic
2. Generates multiple-choice questions aligned with student difficulty level
3. Evaluates submissions and updates learner profiles
4. Provides explanations and references for incorrect answers

### 1.3 Learning Flow

The typical student interaction follows this progression:

1. **Initial Profiling**: System creates a learner profile with baseline difficulty preferences
2. **Query Interaction**: Student asks questions; system retrieves context and generates personalized explanations
3. **Domain Tracking**: Each interaction updates domain-specific strength/struggle metrics
4. **Assessment Generation**: System generates quizzes tailored to student's current mastery level
5. **Adaptive Adjustment**: Quiz performance modifies difficulty preferences:
   - Score ≥70%: Advance to "independent challenge" level
   - Score 40-69%: Maintain "guided practice" level
   - Score <40%: Provide "foundational guidance" level
6. **Progress Monitoring**: System tracks time-on-task, concepts mastered, and suggested next topics

### 1.4 User Interaction Model

Students interact through two primary interfaces:

**Web Application** (Streamlit-based):
- Question & Answer panel with streaming responses
- Interactive quiz interface with immediate feedback
- Document upload for temporary context injection
- Progress dashboard showing domain strengths

**Command-Line Interface**:
- Batch document ingestion: `ai-tutor ingest ./data/raw`
- Direct questioning: `ai-tutor ask student123 "What is Newton's Second Law?"`
- Session management: `python scripts/clear_sessions.py`

---

## Page 2: System Architecture and AI Logic

### 2.1 Technical Architecture

The system employs a modular, layered architecture:

#### Component Layers

**Presentation Layer**
- Streamlit web application (`apps/ui.py`, `scripts/tutor_web.py`)
- CLI interface (`src/ai_tutor/cli.py`)

**Application Layer**
- `TutorSystem`: Facade coordinating all components
- `TutorAgent`: Multi-agent orchestrator using OpenAI Agents SDK
- `QuizService`: Assessment generation and evaluation
- `PersonalizationManager`: Adaptive learning logic

**Domain Layer**
- `ProgressTracker`: Learner profile persistence (JSON)
- `IngestionPipeline`: Document processing workflow
- `Retriever`: Semantic search coordinator

**Infrastructure Layer**
- `EmbeddingClient`: Sentence transformer interface (BAAI/bge-base-en)
- `VectorStore`: Similarity search (supports FAISS, ChromaDB)
- `ChunkJsonlStore`: Chunk metadata storage
- `SQLiteSession`: Conversation history management

#### Configuration System

All system parameters are defined in `config/default.yaml`:
This configuration-driven approach enables rapid experimentation with different models and parameters without code changes.

### 2.2 Multi-Agent System Design

The system utilizes the **OpenAI Agents SDK** to implement a hierarchical multi-agent architecture:

#### Agent Hierarchy

**Orchestrator Agent** (Coordinator):
- **Role**: Intent classification and routing
- **Decision Logic**: Pattern matching on question content
- **Tools**: `generate_quiz()` function
- **Handoffs**: Delegates to specialist agents based on query type

**QA Agent** (STEM Specialist):
- **Role**: Answer STEM questions using local course materials
- **Tools**: `retrieve_local_context()` function
- **Confidence Threshold**: 0.2 minimum for local retrieval
- **Fallback**: Hands off to Web Agent if no relevant local content found
- **Output**: Cited answer with bracketed reference indices

**Web Agent** (Information Retrieval):
- **Role**: Answer current events and non-STEM queries
- **Tools**: `web_search()` via DuckDuckGo
- **Output**: Answer with URL citations

**Ingestion Agent** (Content Management):
- **Role**: Process and ingest new documents
- **Tools**: `ingest_corpus()` function
- **Supported Formats**: PDF (via PyMuPDF), Markdown, TXT

#### Agent Communication Flow

Agents communicate through **handoffs** and **shared state**:

```python
@dataclass
class AgentState:
    last_hits: List[RetrievalHit]
    last_citations: List[str]
    last_source: Optional[str]
    last_quiz: Optional[Quiz]
```

This state object enables the orchestrator to collect results from specialist agents and format them into a unified response.

### 2.3 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline

The RAG implementation ensures all answers are grounded in authoritative sources:

#### Retrieval Process

1. **Query Embedding**:
   - Input: Student question (text)
   - Process: Encode using BAAI/bge-base-en model (768-dimensional embeddings)
   - Output: Query vector

2. **Similarity Search**:
   - Input: Query vector
   - Process: Cosine similarity against all document chunk embeddings
   - Output: Top-k ranked chunks (default k=5)

3. **Context Assembly**:
   - Format retrieved chunks with metadata: `[index] Title (Doc ID, Page: X, Score: Y.YY)`
   - Concatenate chunk texts with separator tokens
   - Add to LLM prompt as grounding context

1. **Citation Formatting**:
   - Parse bracketed indices from response
   - Map to original chunk metadata
   - Format as: `[1] Calculus Volume 1 (Doc: calc_v1, Page: 42)`

### 2.4 Adaptive Personalization Logic

The personalization system maintains and evolves learner profiles:

#### Profile Structure

```python
@dataclass
class LearnerProfile:
    learner_id: str
    name: str
    domain_strengths: Dict[str, float]      # e.g., {"physics": 0.72, "math": 0.58}
    domain_struggles: Dict[str, float]      # e.g., {"cs": 0.35, "chemistry": 0.21}
    concepts_mastered: Dict[str, float]     # e.g., {"derivatives": 0.85}
    total_time_minutes: float
    next_topics: Dict[str, str]             # e.g., {"physics": "momentum"}
    difficulty_preferences: Dict[str, str]  # e.g., {"math": "guided practice"}
```

#### Adaptive Mechanisms

**Style Selection**:
- Mastery ≤0.3: "scaffolded" (step-by-step, high support)
- 0.3 < Mastery < 0.7: "stepwise" (moderate guidance)
- Mastery ≥0.7: "concise" (challenge-oriented, minimal scaffolding)

**Profile Updates After Q&A**:
- Increment domain strength by 0.08
- Adjust struggle score based on current mastery
- Identify next topic from course unit library

**Profile Updates After Quiz**:
- Score ≥70%: +0.12 strength, -0.08 struggle → "independent challenge"
- Score 40-69%: +0.06 strength, no change → "guided practice"
- Score <40%: +0.02 strength, +0.10 struggle → "foundational guidance"

**Topic Recommendation**:
- Scan course unit library for domain
- Identify topics with lowest mastery scores
- Suggest as `next_topics` in profile

## Page 3: Data Pipeline and Assessment System

### 3.1 Document Ingestion Pipeline

The ingestion system transforms raw educational materials into searchable knowledge:

#### Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1: Document Parsing**
- **Input**: PDF, Markdown, or TXT files
- **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF extracts text with page numbers
- **Markdown Processing**: markdown-it-py parses structured content
- **Metadata Extraction**: Title, author, domain inference from filename
- **Output**: `Document` objects with structured metadata

**Stage 2: Text Chunking**
- **Algorithm**: Sliding window with overlap
- **Parameters**: 
  - Chunk size: 500 tokens
  - Overlap: 80 tokens (16% overlap for context continuity)
- **Purpose**: Balance granularity (precise retrieval) with coherence (meaningful context)
- **Metadata Preservation**: Each chunk retains parent document ID, page number, domain
- **Output**: `Chunk` objects with text and metadata

**Stage 3: Embedding Generation**
- **Model**: BAAI/bge-base-en (sentence-transformers)
- **Batch Processing**: 256 chunks per batch for efficiency
- **Normalization**: L2 normalization for cosine similarity
- **Dimensionality**: 768-dimensional dense vectors
- **Output**: Embedding vectors attached to chunks

**Stage 4: Persistence**
- **Chunk Storage**: JSONL format (`data/processed/chunks.jsonl`)
  - One chunk per line with metadata and text
  - Enables incremental updates and streaming access
- **Vector Indexing**: 
  - FAISS index for efficient similarity search
  - Saved to `data/vector_store/embeddings.npy`
  - Metadata mapping in `data/vector_store/metadata.json`
- **Deduplication**: Chunks indexed by ID to prevent duplicates

#### Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: ~50 pages/minute on standard CPU
- **Storage Efficiency**: ~2KB per chunk (text + metadata)
- **Search Latency**: <100ms for top-5 retrieval on 10K chunks

### 3.2 Data Storage Architecture

The system uses a hybrid storage approach optimized for different data types:

#### Storage Components

**1. Document Chunks** (`chunks.jsonl`):
```json
{
  "chunk_id": "calc_v1_ch3_p42_0",
  "doc_id": "calc_v1",
  "text": "The derivative of a function measures...",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "Calculus Volume 1",
    "page": 42,
    "domain": "math",
    "chapter": 3
  }
}
```

**2. Vector Embeddings** (`embeddings.npy` + `metadata.json`):
- NumPy array: (N_chunks, 768) float32
- FAISS index for approximate nearest neighbors
- Metadata JSON maps indices to chunk IDs

**3. Learner Profiles** (`profiles/*.json`):
```json
{
  "learner_id": "student123",
  "name": "Alice Johnson",
  "domain_strengths": {"physics": 0.72, "math": 0.58},
  "domain_struggles": {"cs": 0.35},
  "concepts_mastered": {"derivatives": 0.85, "limits": 0.91},
  "total_time_minutes": 247.5,
  "difficulty_preferences": {"math": "guided practice"}
}
```

**4. Conversation Sessions** (`sessions.sqlite`):
- SQLite database with automatic daily rotation
- Session ID format: `ai_tutor_{learner_id}_{YYYYMMDD}`
- Prevents token overflow by limiting context to same-day conversations
- Schema: `(session_id, role, content, timestamp)`

### 3.3 Quiz Generation and Evaluation

The assessment system creates adaptive quizzes grounded in course materials:

#### Quiz Generation Workflow

**Step 1: Context Retrieval**
- Embed quiz topic using same encoder as Q&A
- Retrieve top-k relevant chunks from vector store
- Include session context if student uploaded documents

**Step 2: Learner Profile Integration**
- Load student's domain strengths and struggles
- Determine current difficulty level for topic domain
- Identify prerequisite concepts from mastery tracking

**Step 3: LLM-Based Question Generation**
```
System Prompt:
"You are a STEM tutoring assistant that creates multiple-choice quizzes.
Respond with strict JSON matching this schema:
{
  'topic': str,
  'difficulty': str,
  'questions': [
    {
      'question': str,
      'choices': [str, str, str, str],
      'correct_index': int (0-3),
      'explanation': str,
      'references': [str, ...]
    }
  ]
}"

User Prompt:
"Create a quiz on: Derivatives
Number of questions: 4
Target difficulty: guided practice
Learner summary: Alice | Top strengths: calculus (0.72) | Needs support: limits (0.35)

Retrieved passages:
[1] Calculus Volume 1 (Page 42): The derivative represents the instantaneous rate...
[2] Calculus Volume 1 (Page 45): The power rule states that d/dx[x^n] = nx^(n-1)...
"
```

**Step 4: Validation and Formatting**
- Parse JSON response
- Validate using Pydantic models (`QuizQuestion`, `Quiz`)
- Ensure exactly 4 choices per question
- Verify correct_index in range [0, 3]
- Attach references from retrieved chunks

#### Quiz Evaluation Mechanism

**Answer Processing**:
```python
# Student submits: [2, 0, 1, 3] (indices of selected choices)
# System compares against correct_indices: [2, 1, 1, 3]

results = [
  QuizAnswerResult(index=0, is_correct=True, selected=2, correct=2),
  QuizAnswerResult(index=1, is_correct=False, selected=0, correct=1),
  QuizAnswerResult(index=2, is_correct=True, selected=1, correct=1),
  QuizAnswerResult(index=3, is_correct=True, selected=3, correct=3)
]

score = 3/4 = 0.75 (75%)
```

**Profile Update Logic**:
- **Score ≥70%**: Strong performance
  - Strength +0.12, Struggle -0.08
  - Difficulty → "independent challenge"
  - Unlock advanced topics
  
- **Score 40-69%**: Moderate performance
  - Strength +0.06, Struggle unchanged
  - Difficulty → "guided practice"
  - Maintain current topic level
  
- **Score <40%**: Needs reinforcement
  - Strength +0.02, Struggle +0.10
  - Difficulty → "foundational guidance"
  - Suggest prerequisite review

**Feedback Generation**:
- For each incorrect answer: display correct choice and explanation
- Aggregate review topics from missed questions
- Provide references for deeper study
- Update `concepts_mastered` with correct count per domain

### 3.4 Session and Memory Management

To prevent token overflow in long conversations, the system implements automatic session rotation:

**Daily Rotation Strategy**:
- Session ID includes date: `ai_tutor_student123_20251023`
- Each new day creates fresh session
- Previous day's context is archived but not loaded
- Limits context window to ~10-20 exchanges per day

**Manual Session Clearing**:
```bash
# View all sessions
python scripts/clear_sessions.py

# Clear specific learner
python scripts/clear_sessions.py student123

# Clear all sessions
python scripts/clear_sessions.py all
```
