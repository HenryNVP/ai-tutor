## Feature Details

### 📚 Corpus Management Tab

#### Document Ingestion
- **Multi-file Upload**: Select multiple documents (PDF, MD, TXT) at once

  - Chunks are embedded using BAAI/bge-base-en model
  - Embeddings stored in vector database (FAISS)
  - Metadata stored in JSONL format
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback on ingestion status
- **Error Handling**: Failed files are skipped and reported

#### Corpus Analysis
- **Statistics Dashboard**:
  - Total documents in corpus
  - Total chunks created
  - Average chunks per document
  - Domain distribution (math, physics, cs, general)
  
- **Document List**: View all ingested documents with titles and IDs

- **Sample Topics**: Random sample of chunk content showing coverage across domains

### 📝 Quiz Builder Tab

#### Quiz Generation
- **Topic Selection**: Enter any topic related to corpus content

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Ingesting Physics Textbooks

1. Navigate to **📚 Corpus Management** tab
2. Click "Browse files" under Upload & Ingest
3. Select multiple physics PDFs (e.g., `collegephysicsvol1.pdf`, `collegephysicsvol2.pdf`)
4. Review file list and sizes
5. Click **🚀 Ingest Files into Vector Store**
6. Wait for processing (typically 1-2 minutes per file)
7. See confirmation: "Successfully ingested 2 documents into 450 chunks!"

### Example 2: Analyzing Corpus Coverage

1. After ingestion, click **🔍 Analyze Corpus**
2. View statistics:
   - 📄 Documents: 5
   - 🧩 Chunks: 1,247
   - 📏 Avg Chunks/Doc: 249.4
3. Check domain distribution:
   - physics: 820 chunks (65.7%)
   - math: 312 chunks (25.0%)
   - general: 115 chunks (9.2%)
4. Expand "Sample Topics Coverage" to preview content

### Example 3: Generating Grounded Quiz

1. Navigate to **📝 Quiz Builder** tab
2. Enter topic: "Newton's Laws of Motion"
3. Set questions: 5
4. Select difficulty: "Balanced"
5. Ensure "Ground quiz in retrieved passages" is checked
6. Click **✨ Generate Quiz**
7. System retrieves 5 relevant passages from physics corpus
8. Quiz generated with questions based on actual textbook content

### Example 4: Editing and Exporting Quiz

1. After generation, click **✏️ Edit Quiz**
2. Modify markdown text:
   ```markdown
   ## Question 1
   What is Newton's First Law?
   
   ○ **A.** F = ma
   ✓ **B.** An object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon
   ○ **C.** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction
   ○ **D.** Acceleration is proportional to force
   ```
3. Switch back to **👁️ Preview Quiz** to verify changes
4. Click **⬇️ Download as Markdown**
5. File saved as `quiz_newtons_laws_of_motion.md`

## Technical Implementation

### Reuse of Existing Components

The new features leverage existing system components:

1. **Ingestion Pipeline**: 
   - Uses `system.ingest_directory()` method
   - Reuses `IngestionPipeline` class from `src/ai_tutor/ingestion/pipeline.py`
   - Maintains consistency with CLI ingestion

2. **Vector Store**: 
   - Accesses same `chunk_store` and `vector_store` as Q&A system
   - Ensures quizzes use identical retrieval as chat

3. **Quiz Service**:
   - Calls `system.generate_quiz()` with extra_context parameter
   - Context populated from retrieval results
   - Grounds questions in actual course materials

### Data Flow

```
Upload Files → Temp Directory → Ingestion Pipeline
                                        ↓
                        Parse → Chunk → Embed → Store
                                        ↓
                                  Vector Store
                                        ↓
                        ← Retrieve ← Quiz Topic
                                        ↓
                        LLM Generation with Context
                                        ↓
                        Quiz → Preview/Edit → Markdown Export
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Ingestion Speed**: ~50 pages/minute on standard CPU
- **Memory Usage**: ~2KB per chunk during processing
- **Batch Embedding**: 256 chunks processed simultaneously
- **Vector Search**: <100ms for top-5 retrieval on 10K chunks

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Bulk Quiz Generation**: Generate multiple quizzes in one batch
2. **Quiz Templates**: Save and reuse quiz formats
3. **Progress Visualization**: Track corpus growth over time
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Search chunks by domain, document, or date
5. **Export Formats**: Support for PDF, DOCX, or interactive HTML quizzes

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: "No documents in corpus" after ingestion  
**Solution**: Check ingestion result for errors. Ensure PDFs are text-based, not scanned images.

**Problem**: Quiz not grounded in corpus content  
**Solution**: Ensure "Ground quiz in retrieved passages" is checked. Try broader topic terms if no passages retrieved.

**Problem**: Download button not appearing  
**Solution**: Generate a quiz first. Ensure quiz generation completed successfully.
