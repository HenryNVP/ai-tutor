# LLM Intent Detection vs Keyword Matching

## 📊 Side-by-Side Comparison

### Example: "Create 10 quizzes from the documents"

#### ❌ Keyword Matching Approach (Current)

```python
def detect_quiz_request(message: str) -> bool:
    patterns = [
        r"\b(create|generate|make)\s+.*?\bquiz",
        r"\bquiz\s+me\b",
        # ... 10+ patterns
    ]
    for pattern in patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, message_lower):
            return True
    return False

def extract_count(message: str) -> int:
    # Manual parsing - fragile!
    numbers = re.findall(r'\b(\d+)\b', message)
    if numbers:
        return int(numbers[0])
    return 4

def detect_document_source(message: str) -> bool:
    keywords = ["from documents", "from files", "from my pdfs"]
    return any(kw in message.lower() for kw in keywords)

# Usage
if detect_quiz_request(prompt):
    count = extract_count(prompt)
    from_docs = detect_document_source(prompt)
    topic = "unknown"  # How to extract?
    generate_quiz(topic, count, from_docs)
```

**Problems:**
- 🔴 3 separate regex patterns to maintain
- 🔴 Misses "gimme practice questions", "i need to study"
- 🔴 Breaks with typos: "crate 10 quizes"
- 🔴 Hard to extract topic: "quiz me on neural networks"
- 🔴 No context understanding
- 🔴 Pattern explosion as you add features

#### ✅ LLM Intent Detection (New)

```python
from ai_tutor.agents.intent_detector import TutorIntentDetector

detector = TutorIntentDetector()

# ONE call - understands everything
intent = detector.detect_intent(
    user_message="Create 10 quizzes from the documents",
    has_uploaded_docs=True,
    uploaded_doc_info="Lecture9.pdf, Lecture10.pdf"
)

# Result:
{
    'action': 'generate_quiz',
    'params': {
        'topic': 'uploaded_documents',
        'num_questions': 10,
        'from_uploaded_documents': True
    },
    'confidence': 'high'
}

# Usage - everything is extracted!
if intent['action'] == 'generate_quiz':
    params = intent['params']
    generate_quiz(
        topic=params['topic'],
        count=params['num_questions'],
        from_docs=params['from_uploaded_documents']
    )
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single function call
- ✅ Automatic parameter extraction
- ✅ Handles variations, typos, informal language
- ✅ Context-aware (knows about uploaded docs)
- ✅ Easy to extend (modify tool descriptions)

## 🧪 Test Cases Comparison

| User Input | Keyword Match | LLM Detection |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| "Create 10 quizzes from the documents" | ✅ Works | ✅ Works (better) |
| "gimme some practice questions" | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| "I want to test my knowledge" | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| "Make me 5 mcq on neural networks" | ⚠️ Detects quiz, misses topic | ✅ Works (extracts topic!) |
| "crate 10 quizes" (typos) | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| "Can you quiz the PDFs I gave you?" | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| "I need to practice what I learned" | ❌ Fails | ✅ Works |
| "Test me on computer vision" | ✅ Works | ✅ Works (extracts topic!) |
| "What is YOLO?" | ✅ Works (not quiz) | ✅ Works (not quiz) |

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Keyword Matching
- **Cost:** $0
- **Development time:** High (maintain complex regex)
- **Maintenance:** Constant updates needed

### LLM Intent Detection
- **Cost per request:** ~$0.0001 (gpt-4o-mini)
- **Cost for 1000 requests:** $0.10
- **Development time:** Low (write tool descriptions once)
- **Maintenance:** Minimal (just update descriptions)

**Verdict:** LLM approach costs pennies but saves hours of development time!

## 🎯 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Natural Language

**User:** "hey can you gimme some practice questions on the stuff I uploaded earlier"

**Keyword Matching:**
```python
❌ "create quiz" not found
❌ "generate quiz" not found  
❌ "quiz me" not found
→ Treats as regular question
```

**LLM Detection:**
```python
✅ Understands: "practice questions" = quiz
✅ Extracts: from_uploaded_documents = True
✅ Topic: "uploaded_documents"
→ Generates quiz correctly!
```

---

### Example 2: Parameter Extraction

**User:** "make me 15 questions about convolutional neural networks"

**Keyword Matching:**
```python
✅ Detects: quiz request
✅ Extracts: num = 15
❌ Topic extraction: complex regex needed
❌ Doesn't know if it's from docs or general knowledge
```

**LLM Detection:**
```python
✅ Detects: quiz request
✅ Extracts: num = 15
✅ Extracts: topic = "convolutional neural networks"
✅ Knows: from_uploaded_documents = False (general)
```

---

### Example 3: Context Awareness

**User:** "quiz me" (after uploading CNN_lecture.pdf)

**Keyword Matching:**
```python
✅ Detects: quiz request
❌ No idea what topic
❌ Doesn't know about uploaded file
→ Generic quiz or error
```

**LLM Detection:**
```python
✅ Detects: quiz request  
✅ Sees context: has_uploaded_docs = True
✅ Infers: from_uploaded_documents = True
✅ Topic: "uploaded_documents"
→ Quiz from user's content!
```

## 🔧 Implementation Complexity

### Keyword Matching
```python
# Need to write:
1. detect_quiz_request() - 30 lines, multiple regex
2. extract_question_count() - 15 lines, number parsing
3. detect_document_source() - 20 lines, keyword matching
4. extract_topic() - 40 lines, complex NLP
5. Unit tests for all edge cases - 200+ lines

Total: ~300+ lines of fragile code
```

### LLM Intent Detection
```python
# Need to write:
1. Define tools (JSON) - 50 lines (declarative, readable)
2. Call OpenAI API - 10 lines
3. Parse result - 5 lines

Total: ~65 lines of robust code
```

## 🚀 Extending the System

### Adding "Create Study Plan" Feature

**Keyword Matching:**
```python
# Need to add:
def detect_study_plan_request(message: str) -> bool:
    patterns = [
        r"create.*study.*plan",
        r"make.*study.*plan",
        r"generate.*study.*plan",
        r"study plan",
        r"learning plan",
        # ... more patterns
    ]
    # 20+ lines of code

def extract_study_plan_params(message: str) -> dict:
    # Extract subject, duration, goals...
    # 50+ lines of complex parsing
```

**LLM Detection:**
```python
# Just add tool definition:
{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "create_study_plan",
        "description": "Create a personalized study plan",
        "parameters": {
            "subject": {"type": "string"},
            "duration_weeks": {"type": "integer"},
            "goals": {"type": "array"}
        }
    }
}
# Done! ~15 lines, LLM handles the rest
```

---

## 📈 Scalability

### Keyword Matching
```
Features: 1  → Code: 50 lines
Features: 5  → Code: 250 lines  (grows linearly)
Features: 10 → Code: 500 lines  (maintenance nightmare)
```

### LLM Detection
```
Features: 1  → Code: 70 lines
Features: 5  → Code: 120 lines (grows slowly)
Features: 10 → Code: 170 lines (manageable)
```

## 🎓 Recommendation

### Use LLM Intent Detection If:
- ✅ You want natural language understanding
- ✅ You want to support many variations
- ✅ You want automatic parameter extraction
- ✅ You plan to add more features
- ✅ Cost is negligible (~$0.0001/request)

### Stick with Keywords If:
- ✅ You have ZERO budget for API calls
- ✅ You have a very limited set of commands
- ✅ You need offline functionality
- ✅ You have strict latency requirements (< 100ms)

**For an AI Tutor:** LLM Intent Detection is the clear winner! 🏆

## 📝 Migration Path

### Phase 1: Add LLM Detection (Parallel)
```python
# Try LLM first, fallback to keywords
if st.session_state.intent_detector:
    intent = detector.detect_intent(...)
    if intent['confidence'] == 'high':
        use_llm_result(intent)
    else:
        use_keyword_matching()
else:
    use_keyword_matching()
```

### Phase 2: Monitor & Tune
- Log both approaches
- Compare accuracy
- Tune tool descriptions if needed

### Phase 3: Full Migration
- Remove keyword matching code
- Simplify codebase
- Add more features easily!
